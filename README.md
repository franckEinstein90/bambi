# bambi

Bambi contains several macros and objects that facilitate event processing, management, and visualization.  Events can be recurring in a cyclic patterns, triggered by environmental changes, manual triggers, or date/time parameters. 

Bambi lets you define what happens when an event flips from on to off or vice-versa. Program flips to trigger other events, or execute actions, such as emailing, creating invoices, or even adding entries to a database. 

Bambi adds functionality associated with "events". A bambi event is a bundle of information/actions associated with a status of either "ongoing" or "offgoing." Events are flipped when they go from offgoing to ongoing or vice-versa.

What you can do with Bambi:
* Link events to other events to easily create automation pipelines. 
* Connect events to information sources updated in real time to create live visualizations and dashboards
* create automated checklists
* Use bambi's stochaistic functions to create Markov models
* Monitor systems in real-time
* Create "smart" calendars that automatically update themselves based on changing circumnstances

Bambi tools and features:
