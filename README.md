# bambi
Bambi contains several macros and objects to facilitate the management of events in confluence.
- calendar
- timetable
- checklist
- several kinds of event objects. 

bambi can be used as a simple calendar, but it does much more. 

Bambi adds functionality associated with "events". A bambi event is a bundle of information/actions associated with a status of either "ongoing" or "offgoing." Events are flipped when they go from offgoing to ongoing or vice-versa. Triggers for flips can be:

- dates, or 
- date-patterns (every wedneday at 4PM) 
- the completion of one or several Jira tasks, 
- the change in statuses of other events. 
- manually
